## 📋 **Daily Action Plan**

### **Day 1-2: Test Suite Excellence Push**

#### **Critical Test Failures Resolution**
**Target: Fix 7+ remaining failing tests**

**Priority 1: ModuleLoader Timeout Issues**
```bash
# Location: src/utils/__tests__/dynamicImports.test.tsx
# Issue: 7s+ timeouts on module loading tests
# Solution: Implement proper module caching and timeout handling
```

**Priority 2: TensorFlow Test Isolation**
```bash
# Location: src/components/__tests__/AI*.test.tsx
# Issue: State leakage between AI model tests
# Solution: Add comprehensive cleanup and model disposal
```

**Priority 3: Touch/Mobile API Edge Cases**
```bash
# Location: src/utils/__tests__/mobile*.test.tsx
# Issue: Battery API and device detection failures
# Solution: Enhanced mock coverage for mobile APIs
```

## üìä Implementation Summary

### 1. Comprehensive Mock Infrastructure Created ‚úÖ

Created centralized mock utilities for all major browser APIs:

1. **Web Audio API Mock** (`src/__mocks__/webAudioMock.ts`)
   - Complete AudioContext implementation
   - AnalyserNode with frequency data simulation
   - MediaDevices and getUserMedia support
   - Audio node connection/disconnection handling

2. **WebGPU/WebGL Mock** (`src/__mocks__/webGPUMock.ts`)
   - GPU adapter and device simulation
   - WebGL context with capabilities
   - OffscreenCanvas support
   - Three.js renderer capabilities

3. **MIDI API Mock** (`src/__mocks__/midiMock.ts`)
   - Complete Web MIDI API implementation
   - MIDI input/output device simulation
   - Message sending and event handling
   - Common MIDI message utilities

4. **DOM/Window Mock** (`src/__mocks__/domMock.ts`)
   - Service Worker registration
   - Document createElement with proper attributes
   - Window.confirm and other dialog methods
   - Performance and animation frame APIs

5. **Centralized Setup** (`src/__mocks__/setupMocks.ts`)
   - Combined setup/cleanup functions
   - Jest lifecycle integration
   - Individual mock exports for selective use

### 2. Test File Improvements Implemented ‚úÖ

#### AIVJMaster Tests
- Fixed promise rejection handling for initialization failures
- Corrected WebGPU fallback testing
- Enhanced MIDI manager mocking with all required methods
- Fixed syntax errors in mock implementations

#### Service Worker Tests
- Replaced custom window mocks with comprehensive DOM mocks
- Fixed window.confirm mock setup issues
- Improved cleanup and state management

#### Alerting System Tests
- Modified test approach to process metrics over time
- Fixed fake timers configuration
- Improved alert triggering validation

#### Image Optimization Tests
- Migrated to centralized DOM mocks
- Fixed document.createElement expectations
- Enhanced canvas mock functionality

#### Audio Analyzer Tests
- Integrated comprehensive Web Audio mocks
- Fixed getUserMedia mock references
- Improved error handling tests

#### Dynamic Imports Tests
- Increased test timeout for dynamic loading
- Fixed module loader timeout handling
- Improved error scenario testing

### 3. Key Patterns Established ‚úÖ

1. **Mock Isolation**: Each test suite uses isolated mock instances
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Proper setup/cleanup with beforeAll/afterAll
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mocks
4. **Realistic Behavior**: Mocks simulate real API behavior accurately
5. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error case handling

## üîç Challenges Encountered

### 1. Global Object Conflicts
- **Issue**: Window/navigator objects already defined by jsdom
- **Solution**: Conditional property definition with existence checks
- **Learning**: Test environment setup order matters

### 2. Mock Complexity
- **Issue**: Browser APIs have deep interdependencies
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mock objects with full API surface
- **Learning**: Partial mocks often cause more issues than they solve

### 3. Timing and Async Issues
- **Issue**: Test timing conflicts with fake timers
- **Solution**: Proper fake timer configuration per test suite
- **Learning**: Legacy fake timers needed for some scenarios

### 4. Module Loading
- **Issue**: Dynamic imports difficult to test reliably
- **Solution**: Increased timeouts and improved mock strategies
- **Learning**: Dynamic module testing requires special handling

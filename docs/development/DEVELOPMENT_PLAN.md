# VJ Application Development Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase, this plan outlines a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach for migrating to a modular architecture while enabling **parallel development workflows**.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Existing Components Quality Assessment
- **High-quality React/TypeScript codebase** with excellent patterns
- **Well-structured state management** using Zustand
- **Performance-optimized** rendering with proper memoization
- **Comprehensive error handling** and browser compatibility
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Missing**: Test coverage, modular architecture, AWS integration

### Technical Debt
- **Monolithic structure** limiting team scalability
- **No test coverage** creating maintenance risks
- **Unused dependencies** (TensorFlow.js, Three.js, ML5, P5.js)
- **Single deployment target** lacking environment separation

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Framework

### Testing Pyramid Structure
```
                    🔺 E2E Tests (10%)
                   /   Cypress/Playwright
                  /    Full user workflows
                 /
              🔺 Integration Tests (20%)
             /   Testing Library + MSW  
            /    Module interactions
           /     API integrations
          /
       🔺 Unit Tests (70%)
      /   Jest + Testing Library
     /    Component behavior
    /     Business logic
   /      Utility functions
  🔺
```

### TDD Workflow per Module
```
1. 🔴 RED: Write failing test
2. 🟢 GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
3. 🔵 REFACTOR: Improve code quality
4. 📄 DOCUMENT: Update documentation
5. 🔄 REPEAT: Next feature/component
```

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: ≥90% code coverage per module
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints and WebSocket events
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user paths (audio start → visual render → preset save)
- **Performance Tests**: Rendering FPS, audio latency, sync delays

## 🚀 Parallel Development Enablement

### Module Independence Strategy
```
visual-renderer/
├── package.json          # Independent dependencies
├── jest.config.js        # Module-specific test config
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Self-contained components
│   ├── hooks/           # Module-specific hooks
│   ├── utils/           # Pure utility functions
│   └── __tests__/       # Comprehensive test suite
└── README.md            # Module documentation
```

### Shared Dependencies Management
```
root/
├── shared/
│   ├── types/           # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── constants/       # Shared constants
│   ├── utils/          # Cross-module utilities
│   └── test-utils/     # Shared testing utilities
└── package.json        # Root workspace management
```

### Communication Contracts
**Inter-module APIs defined upfront:**
```typescript
// Event Types for sync-core
interface AudioDataEvent {
  type: 'AUDIO_DATA'
  frequencies: Float32Array
  waveform: Float32Array
  timestamp: number
}

interface ParameterUpdateEvent {
  type: 'PARAMETER_UPDATE'
  layerId: string
  parameter: string
  value: any
  source: 'controller' | 'voice' | 'midi'
}
```

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Root workspace commands
npm run dev                    # Start all modules in parallel
npm run test                   # Run all module tests
npm run test:watch            # Watch mode for active development
npm run build                 # Build all modules
npm run lint                  # Lint all modules

# Module-specific commands  
npm run dev:visual-renderer   # Start only visual renderer
npm run test:vj-controller    # Test only controller module
npm run build:sync-core       # Build only sync core
```
